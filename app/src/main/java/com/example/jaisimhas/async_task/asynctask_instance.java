 //If the main activity undergoes onstop due to rotation of the tablet we have to take precautions to avoid memory leaks.
 //This needs to be factored in.
 
//Async task can be defined as private inner class of the Activity Class (main thread). Here
// we can call methods of the Activity Class from side onPostExectue

//Example
//public class MainActivity extends Activity {
// â€¦...
//  static public class MyAsyncTask extends AsyncTask<Void, Void, String>   {
//     @Override protected String doInBackground(Void... params) {...}
//     @Override protected void onPostExecute(String result) {...}
// }
//}

//OR
//Async Task subclass of Async Task which is separate public class. Here we can reference main activity clas
//and use this to call methods from onPostExecute


//Async tasks are meant for short operations that need to occur in the background.
//The async task allows for background operations to be performed and then reported to the
//main activity thread.

//Async Task has 3 parameters Parameters, Progress and Resul
//Param is passed during execute method call
//progress is provided through publishProgress(Progress ..values) which will cause an update to UI thread
//context onProgressUpdate(Progress...values)
//onPostExecute will provide the oepration after doInBackground operation completes. This will trigger method call to UI Thread.
public class asynctask_instance extends AsyncTask<Integer, Void, String> {

    private MainActivity activity;

    //define the constructor
    public asynctask_instance(MainActivity context)
    {

        activity = context;
    }

    protected String doInBackground(Integer ...numbers)

        Log.w("MainActivity", "inside doInBackground");
        return "product from async task doinBackground function";
